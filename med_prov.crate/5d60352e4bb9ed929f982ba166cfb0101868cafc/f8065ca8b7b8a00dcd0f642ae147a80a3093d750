INFO - Please read the following information carefully:

INFO - find_wl_contours2: A method for extracting shorelines that uses the sand water interface detected with the model to refine the threshold that's used to detect shorelines .
  - This is the default method used when there are enough sand pixels within the reference shoreline buffer.

INFO - find_wl_contours1: This shoreline extraction method uses a threshold to differentiate between water and land pixels in images, relying on Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) values. However, it may inaccurately classify snow and ice as water, posing a limitation in certain environments.
  - This is only used when not enough sand pixels are detected within the reference shoreline buffer.
